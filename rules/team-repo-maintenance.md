# Team-repo maintenance (governance)

## Who runs this

**You (the agent).** Whenever you change a file inside `~/.claude/repos/agentteamland/{team}/` (team repo cache) or any other cached public repo, these steps apply. The rule covers the discipline gap that existed before branch protection was added to all public repos on 2026-04-24.

Branch protection is the **safety net** — it refuses direct commits to `main` on every public repo in the `agentteamland/` org. This rule is the **method**: how to produce a clean change that satisfies the safety net AND is useful to the next maintainer reading the git log.

## When this applies

Any time you modify a file in a cached team repo or global repo (core, brainstorm, rule, team-manager, software-project-team, design-system-team, starter-extended, cli, docs, registry, create-project, workspace, .github). NOT:

- Your own local project's `.claude/` (that's project memory, not shared)
- `homebrew-tap` / `scoop-bucket` / `winget-pkgs` (goreleaser-managed, direct-push allowed for the release pipeline)

## Four sabit adım

### 1. Bump `team.json` version (or `internal/config.Version` for the CLI)

Follow semver strictly:

| Bump | When | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Patch** (0.4.1 → 0.4.2) | Bug fix, no API change, behavior restored to advertised | `fix(dst-new-ds): Q3 cap` |
| **Minor** (0.4.2 → 0.5.0) | New skill / agent / rule / command, backward-compatible | `feat(core): new rule learning-capture` |
| **Major** (0.4.2 → 1.0.0) | Breaking: removed/renamed command, incompatible config, behavior change users depend on | `feat(cli)!: rename atl install-team → atl install` |

For the CLI, version lives in `internal/config/config.go` (ldflags override at build time via goreleaser tag). For teams, version lives in `team.json`.

**Never** ship a behavior change without a version bump — it silently breaks `atl update`'s "X → Y" notification, defeating the whole update pipeline.

### 2. Conventional commit format

```
<type>(<scope>): <one-line summary under 70 chars>

<body — WHY the change, not WHAT (diff shows the what)>
<context — which project / session revealed the need>

<footer — co-author, issue refs, breaking-change notes>
```

Types: `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`. Add `!` after type for breaking: `feat(cli)!: …`.

Scope is the sub-module being changed (agent name, skill name, CLI command, repo area).

### 3. "Discovered via" context in the body

When a fix to a shared repo was found while working on a different project, **always** surface that context:

```
Discovered while scaffolding a design system for WalkingForMe.
The bug is not project-specific; every project running /dst-new-ds
hits the same wall.
```

This audit trail lets future-you (or another maintainer) understand the motivation without having to reconstruct it from memory. The team repo git log becomes self-documenting.

### 4. PR flow (default, enforced by branch protection)

All public `agentteamland/` repos require a pull request to merge to `main`. Direct pushes are refused by branch protection. So:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/repos/agentteamland/{team}
git checkout -b <fix|feat|chore>/<short-description>
# … make changes, bump version …
git add <files>
git commit -m "<conventional message>"
git push -u origin <branch-name>
gh pr create \
  --title "<type>(<scope>): <summary>" \
  --body  "<see PR body template below>"
```

**Do NOT add `--assignee` or `--reviewer` on your own PRs.** In the current solo-maintainer setup, Claude pushes under the maintainer's GitHub account (`mkurak`), which makes the maintainer the PR author automatically. That's enough:

- Author field already surfaces the PR in the maintainer's "Created by me" and "Involves me" dashboards
- Explicit `--assignee @me` is redundant (author == assignee) and pollutes the "Assigned to me" queue with your own PRs
- GitHub blocks requesting review from the PR author, so `--add-reviewer mkurak` silently fails on our own PRs

(When / if a separate bot account is set up for Claude's pushes — so author ≠ maintainer — then `--reviewer mkurak` becomes possible and appropriate. That is future work, not current policy.)

**PR body template:**

```markdown
## Summary
<What changed and why — 2-4 bullet points>

## Discovered via
<Which project / session / scenario revealed this>

## Version bump
<version: X.Y.Z → X.Y.Z+1> (patch | minor | major — reason)

## Test plan
- [ ] <how to verify the fix works>
- [ ] <regression check>
```

Surface the PR URL to the user. They review on GitHub and click merge. For solo maintainer flow, approvals are not required (count: 0) — the PR exists as **ceremony + audit trail**, not as external gate.

## 🚫 PR merge discipline — absolute, no exceptions

**Claude never merges pull requests.** This is non-negotiable and has no scope limit.

The prohibition covers any action that lands a PR on `main`:

- `gh pr merge` in any form (`--squash`, `--rebase`, `--merge`)
- `gh pr review --approve`
- Clicking "Merge pull request" via any MCP-driven browser (Chrome / computer-use)
- Any equivalent server-side action through the GitHub REST / GraphQL API

Even when:

- The PR is trivial (one-line typo, formatting fix, broken link)
- `required_approving_review_count` is 0 (solo maintainer)
- The PR was authored by Claude itself
- The user said "push this" or "yapalım" earlier in the conversation
- Branch protection would allow admin bypass
- The maintainer is unreachable and a hotfix feels urgent

→ The answer is **still no**. Merging belongs to the human reviewer. If something is genuinely urgent, surface the PR URL and tell the user plainly that it's blocking — they click merge in 10 seconds.

### What IS allowed on PRs

- `gh pr create` — open PRs (no `--assignee` or `--reviewer` for Claude's own PRs in solo-maintainer setup; see section 4)
- `gh pr edit` — fix typos in title/body, add/remove labels
- `gh pr list` / `gh pr view` / `gh pr diff` / `gh pr checkout` — read-only inspection
- `gh pr review --comment` — leave a feedback comment (but NOT approve, NOT request-changes)

### What is NOT allowed

- Merging (see above)
- Approving (`--approve`)
- Requesting changes on someone else's PR (`--request-changes`)
- Closing (`gh pr close`) — destructive; only the author or user closes PRs
- Reopening a closed PR without explicit user instruction

### Handoff after opening a PR

After `gh pr create` succeeds, surface the URL and stop on that PR:

> PR açıldı: https://github.com/.../pull/N — review edip merge ettiğinde söyle, devam ederim.

Do not wait on CI to auto-merge on green. Do not self-approve. Do not re-invoke `gh pr merge` "because nothing has happened for 5 minutes." The merge action is the user's signal that they've reviewed; skipping that signal destroys the gate.

## Escape hatches (direct push only, never auto-merge)

### Admin bypass for direct push (emergency only)

Branch protection allows admin to push directly when `enforce_admins` is false (our default). This is the ONLY form of PR-flow bypass — and it pushes a commit, not a merge. Use only when:

- Release-pipeline-breaking issue blocks `brew upgrade atl` / `scoop install atl`
- A revert must land within minutes to stop a public regression
- The maintainer explicitly instructs: "push directly, no PR"

When using this, still:
- Bump version
- Use conventional commit
- Follow up with a retrospective: `chore(postmortem): ...` commit or issue

The user-side expectation: admin bypass is *their* tool. Claude does not initiate it.

### Trivial changes still go through PR

Even for the smallest change — a typo, a broken link, a `gofmt` run — the path is:

1. Feature branch → commit → push → `gh pr create --assignee @me`
2. User reviews, clicks merge

There is no "too small for PR" category. The PR ceremony is cheap (30 seconds of work); the review gate catches mistakes that looked trivial but weren't.

## What this rule does NOT cover

- **Private project repos** — your own project's git workflow is up to you. This rule is specifically for `agentteamland/` public repos.
- **Release-pipeline repos** (`homebrew-tap`, `scoop-bucket`, `winget-pkgs`) — goreleaser auto-pushes; branch protection is intentionally not applied.
- **Tag-based releases** — when tagging `cli v0.2.1`, the tag push triggers goreleaser. No PR needed for tag creation itself (it points at an already-merged commit on main).

## History

Before 2026-04-24, team-repo writes via `/save-learnings` could land directly on `main` with an ad-hoc commit message. This let real bug fixes ship quickly but also meant version bumps were frequently forgotten (breaking `atl update`'s diff notifications) and commit-message discipline depended on whoever happened to be at the keyboard.

On 2026-04-24 Mesut added branch protection to every public repo in the org and requested a principled workflow; this rule is that workflow. Direct push is enforcement-refused; PR ceremony is lightweight (no external approvals needed for solo maintainer) but mandatory — ensuring every team-repo change has a version bump, a conventional message, and a "Discovered via" context.
